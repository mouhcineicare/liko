# Appointment Flow Test Script

## Overview

The `test-all-appointments-flow.ts` script is a comprehensive test suite that simulates all appointment functionalities from creation to completion across patient, therapist, and admin user types.

## Purpose

This script validates the entire appointment management system by:

1. **Testing all user workflows** - Patient, Therapist, and Admin functionalities
2. **Validating business logic** - Appointment creation, payment, completion, and status management
3. **Ensuring data consistency** - Status synchronization, payment verification, and user balance management
4. **Simulating real scenarios** - Single sessions, recurring sessions, balance payments, and rebooking

## Key Validations

### 1. Appointment Status Logic
- ‚úÖ `isAccepted` and `isConfirmed` flags are set correctly based on therapist assignment
- ‚úÖ Status transitions follow proper business rules
- ‚úÖ Status display is consistent across all user types

### 2. Payment Verification
- ‚úÖ Stripe `checkoutSessionId` and `paymentIntentId` are captured and stored
- ‚úÖ Payment verification prevents session completion for unpaid appointments
- ‚úÖ Customer ID retrieval works for payment history

### 3. Session Management
- ‚úÖ Single session appointments complete properly
- ‚úÖ Recurring session appointments progress correctly
- ‚úÖ Session completion follows 30-minute rule
- ‚úÖ Total sessions and completed sessions stay synchronized

### 4. Balance Management
- ‚úÖ Session balance is deducted correctly
- ‚úÖ Cancellation refunds are calculated properly
- ‚úÖ Balance history is maintained accurately

### 5. Data Consistency
- ‚úÖ Appointment data is consistent across all operations
- ‚úÖ User balance updates are synchronized
- ‚úÖ Status changes are reflected immediately

## Mock Data Structure

The script uses comprehensive mock data to simulate real scenarios:

### Users
- **Patients**: With/without assigned therapists, with/without Stripe customer IDs
- **Therapists**: Available therapists with different specializations
- **Admin**: Admin user with full system access

### Plans
- **Single Session**: Basic single appointment
- **5 Sessions Package**: Multi-session package with discount
- **10 Sessions Package**: Extended package with maximum discount

### Appointments
- **Status Tracking**: All appointment statuses and transitions
- **Payment Integration**: Stripe payment simulation
- **Session Management**: Single and recurring session handling

## Extending the Tests

### Adding New Test Cases
1. Add new function to the appropriate enum (`PatientFunction`, `TherapistFunction`, `AdminFunction`)
2. Implement the test logic in the `MockAPI` class
3. Add the test call in the appropriate test method (`testPatientFlows`, `testTherapistFlows`, `testAdminFlows`)

### Adding New Validations
1. Extend the `TestResult` interface if needed
2. Add validation logic in the test methods
3. Update the report generation to include new metrics

### Adding New Mock Data
1. Extend the mock data objects (`mockUsers`, `mockPlans`, etc.)
2. Update the test scenarios to use new data
3. Ensure data consistency across all tests

## Troubleshooting

### Common Issues
1. **TypeScript Errors**: Ensure all dependencies are installed and TypeScript is configured correctly
2. **Mock Data Issues**: Check that mock data is properly structured and consistent
3. **Test Failures**: Review the detailed error messages in the test output

### Debug Mode
To run with additional debugging information, modify the script to include more detailed logging:

```typescript
// Add debug logging
console.log('Debug: Appointment data:', appointment);
console.log('Debug: User balance:', user.balance);
```

## Integration with Real System

This test script can be adapted to work with the real system by:

1. **Replacing MockAPI with real API calls** - Use actual fetch requests to your API endpoints
2. **Using real database connections** - Connect to your MongoDB instance for data persistence
3. **Integrating with Stripe** - Use real Stripe API calls for payment testing
4. **Adding authentication** - Include real user authentication and session management

## Maintenance

- **Regular Updates**: Update the test script when new features are added
- **Data Validation**: Ensure mock data reflects current business rules
- **Performance Monitoring**: Monitor test execution time and optimize as needed
- **Documentation**: Keep this README updated with new test scenarios and validations
